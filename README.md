### Hi There, I'm Cryental! ðŸŒŸ

I'm Cryental! People often say I look like I've stepped out of a time capsule, but I just giggle and twirl my pink hair. I adore chocolate croissants and anything pink - it's like my signature! ðŸŒ¸

As a whimsical senior software engineer and magical server administrator, I've sprinkled my magic on loads of big projects with various agencies. These days, I'm casting my spells on PHP, creating enchanting potions and codes! ðŸŒŸ

**Enchanted Creations I've Brought to Life:**

- **[Minako API](https://cryental.net/services/anime/api/):** Your go-to spellbook for unlimited, free, open access to the anime realm, no magic barriers!
- **[GeoIP Locations](https://cryental.net/services/geolocation/):** A mystical map to locate and understand the wanderers of your website.
- **[Keycipher Enterprise](https://cryental.net/services/licensing/):** A powerful charm for licensing, filled with secrets and spells.
- **[MemoryJSON (AmberJSON)](https://github.com/Cryental/MemoryJSON):** A memory enchantment within a special JSON grimoire, perfect for bewitching game trainers.
- **[Kayla.NET](https://github.com/Cryental/Kayla.NET):** A spell for transforming subtitles into multiple magical formats.
- **[OhysCrawler.Py](https://github.com/Cryental/OhysCrawler.Py):** A secret pathway to Ohys-raws, crafted with Python spells.
- **And so much more, all sprinkled with pixie dust!**

I pour my heart and soul into weaving high-quality open-source enchantments on my GitHub page. The world of open-source magic is just so spellbinding!

Should my magical creations add a sparkle to your day, Iâ€™d be over the moon to receive your support through donations on my website! ðŸŒ™âœ¨
